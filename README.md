# PersonalWebsite

This is my personal website that I made when I started learning Angular. It uses node for the contact form. This was my first go at the MEAN stack.

# Plans

I currently plan to redesign this whole website from the ground up. I don't like how it looks currently and have learned quite a lot since creating it.
